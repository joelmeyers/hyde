I study theoretical cosmology, including the cosmic microwave background, the early universe, and connections to high energy and particle physics.

You can see my publications on [inSpire](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=exactauthor%3AJoel.Meyers.1 "inSpire Publication List").

## Cosmic Microwave Background

Since the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in 1964, measurements of the CMB have completely transformed our understanding of the history and contents of the universe.  Ongoing and future observations of the CMB will continue to play a primary role in the development of modern cosmology.  I am a member of the [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/ "SO Website") and [CMB-S4](https://cmb-s4.org/ "S4 Website") collaborations, two future ground-based CMB experiments which will survey the CMB with unprecedented sensitivity.

## Inflation

An extremely rapid, nearly exponential expansion of space, known as cosmic inflation, is thought to have occurred in the very early universe.  Quantum fluctuations in the fields that drove this expansion provided the seeds for the cosmological structure observed in the universe today.  The next generation of cosmological surveys seek to find signatures of cosmic inflation and to determine the physics responsible for generating this phase of expansion in the early universe.
