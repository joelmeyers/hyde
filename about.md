I am currently a seinor research associate at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA).  Before joining CITA, I was a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin with Professor Steven Weinberg.  I received my bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics from the University of Wisconsin.
